# DDN Gopher Update 2024-08-04

I learned something cool earlier and made a small change in this commit. As functions generally return two values (such
as a string or an error) it's common to return an empty string instead of `nil` (as `nil` can't be returned in the place of
a string).

However, in the function signature, we can modify our return type to be a pointer to a type instead of a type itself.
So, instead of:

```go
func getValue() (string, error) {
    if someCondition {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("an error occurred")
    }
    return "value", nil
}
```

We can do:

```go
func getValue() (*string, error) {
    if someCondition {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("an error occurred")
    }
    value := "value"
    return &value, nil
}
```
