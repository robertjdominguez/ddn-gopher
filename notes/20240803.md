Coming from the front-end world, my mental model typically revolves around React and how applications are constructed
using it. As such, I'll take a dive into explaining how Bubbletea works relative to React since, at their core,
they're doing pretty much the same thing: handling state and input, and rendering the results.

Bubbletea has three key components: the model, the update function, and the view function.

## Model

### Bubbletea

The model in Bubbletea represents the state of the application. It's a simple struct that holds the data needed for rendering and logic.

```go
type counterModel struct {
    count int
}
```

### React

In React, the model is analogous to the component state. It holds the state data that determines what the component renders.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

const Counter: React.FC = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <p>Press q to quit.</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Update Function

### Bubbletea

The update function in Bubbletea handles messages and updates the model accordingly.

```go
func (m counterModel) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
    switch msg := msg.(type) {
    case tea.KeyMsg:
        switch msg.String() {
        case "q":
            return m, tea.Quit
        case "up":
            m.count++
        case "down":
            m.count--
        }
    }
    return m, nil
}
```

### React

In React, the update function is represented by event handlers and state-setting hooks. These update the component's state in response to events.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

const Counter: React.FC = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleKeyPress = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
      setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
    } else if (event.key === "ArrowDown") {
      setCount((prevCount) => prevCount - 1);
    }
  };

  // Add event listener for key presses
  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener("keydown", handleKeyPress);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("keydown", handleKeyPress);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <p>Press q to quit.</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## View Function

### Bubbletea

The view function in Bubbletea takes the model and returns the string (or inputs, etc.) that should be displayed in the terminal. It determines how the state is rendered.

```go
func (m counterModel) View() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Count: %d
Press q to quit.", m.count)
}
```

### React

In React, the view function is the return statement of the functional component. It returns the TSX that represents the component's UI based on the state.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

const Counter: React.FC = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <p>Press q to quit.</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Summary

1. **Model**:

   - **Bubbletea**: A simple struct holding the application's state.
   - **React**: State is managed within a functional component using hooks, typically with `useState`.

2. **Update Function**:

   - **Bubbletea**: A function handling messages and updating the model.
   - **React**: Event handlers that use hooks to update the component's state.

3. **View Function**:
   - **Bubbletea**: Returns a string for the terminal based on the model.
   - **React**: Returns TSX for the browser based on the component state.
