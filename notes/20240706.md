# DDN Gopher Update 2024-07-06

## Live-reloading

I wanted to make the feedback loop a bit more concise, so I added [a package called `air`](https://github.com/air-verse/air) that allows for hot-reloading.
It watches files and, whenever there's a change, rebuilds the application. Right now, I've only modified the dockerfile
for the `auth-server` service to use this. But, when I pick up the CLI soon, I'll use it there as well.

It's pretty easy to use. The dockerfile now looks like this:

```yaml
FROM golang:latest

RUN go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest

WORKDIR /app

COPY auth-server/go.mod auth-server/go.sum ./

RUN go mod download

COPY auth-server/ .

CMD ["air"]
```

Then, I just modify the `docker-compose.yaml` in the root of the project to mount two volumes for `air` to use:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./auth-server:/app
  - /app/tmp
```

## Starting to play around with tests

Before I dive into the CLI, I want to get a better understanding of tests in Go. With the standard library and the Go
CLI being so powerful, I want to solidify my understanding of what they can do without other packages. Also, before
starting the CLI work for this application, I'd like to better understand TDD in Go.

On that note, I've been using [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests). It's a great companion
to other learning materials I've been using. To get my feet wet in this suite of applications, I've written a single
test for the auth-server:

```go
package utils

import (
	"testing"
)

func TestCheckForUser(t *testing.T) {
	t.Run("return an error if no username is passed", func(t *testing.T) {
		_, got := CheckForUser("")
		want := ErrEmptyUsername
		if got != want {
			t.Errorf("got %v, want %v", got, ErrEmptyUsername)
		}
	})
}
```

Also, you were right about needing an `errors` package...when I went to test the error that's now returned by the
`CheckForUser()` function, it became clear that instantiating a new error each time wouldn't allow for value
comparisons. So, by creating a new top-level error — such as `ErrEmptyUsername` — I can reuse it to compare the
returned error from the function and ensure the test passes:

```go
var ErrEmptyUsername = errors.New("username cannot be an empty string")

func CheckForUser(username string) (map[string]interface{}, error) {
	client := CreateClient()

	// Check to see if there is a non-empty string for the username
	if username == "" {
		return nil, ErrEmptyUsername
	}

	// Define variables for the query
	variables := map[string]interface{}{
		"username": username,
	}

	token, err := GenerateJWT("", 0, "admin")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Execute the query
	respData, err := QueryHasura(client, UserQuery, variables, token)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	return respData, nil
}
```

I'll soon move this error out into its own package along with any others as I spend a week or so solidifying the
auth-server with a suite of tests.

Then, at the end of next week, I'll hopefully be able to pick up working on the CLI piece.
